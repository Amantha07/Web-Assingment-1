			<h2>We as a team thuruliya our travelling expedition years back to explore the miracles and adventures of the mother nature. We hold that nature is beyond all the comparisons that need to be cared, loved, cherished and preserved for generations of generations to come. In truth, if we as humans neglect our duty of taking the depletion of natural resources like trees, water, soil seriously to manage the little amounts of such resources left sustainably, our future generations will face a scarcity of them or will run out of them completely.That is the sole reason which made us to lead our way to start "Thuru Liya" which will be a small step yet an impactful one if you all join your hands together with us to bless the earth with more trees to give a new life to our Earth and make it a better place for generations and generations of the human race.</h2>
